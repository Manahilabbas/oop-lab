You are required to implement a simple message handling system using object-oriented
programming in C++.
Task Breakdown:
1. Create a Message class
o It should have a private instance variable text of type string to store the message
content.
o Implement a method toString() that returns the message text.
o Provide a setter method to modify the text value.
2. Create an SMS class that inherits from Message
o It should have an additional instance variable recipientContactNo to store the
recipient’s phone number.
o Implement appropriate accessor and mutator methods.
o Override the toString() method to return a concatenated string containing the
recipient’s contact number and the message text.
3. Create an Email class that inherits from Message
o It should have additional instance variables: sender, receiver, and subject.
o Implement appropriate accessor and mutator methods.
o Override the toString() method to return a concatenated string containing sender,
receiver, subject, and the message text.
4. Implement Keyword Search Function
o Define a function:
o bool ContainsKeyword(const Message& messageObject, const string& keyword);
o This function should return true if the text of the Message object contains the
given keyword, otherwise return false.

5. Implement Message Encoding
o Define a function to encode a given message using the following scheme:
 Each character should be replaced by the next character in the alphabet
(e.g., ‘A’ → ‘B’, ‘b’ → ‘c’, ‘Z’ → ‘A’, ‘z’ → ‘a’).
 Example: If the message is "This is Java", the encoded message should be
"Uijt jt Kbwb".
6. Test the Implementation
o In the main() function, create sample objects of SMS and Email, assign values,
and test the functionalities including keyword search and encoding.
